/*
Data acquisition : backlight off, nothing running except of cpuburn-a53 running on one core, battery reading done every 5 sec with 3 digits precision.
Since the system is powered with a Li-ion battery, the voltage drop at this load (25% of the cpu) is around 0.05v, similar result during emulation.

To avoid usage of float or double, battery voltage is multiply by 1000.

Note: Following data has been smooth to avoid value crossing
